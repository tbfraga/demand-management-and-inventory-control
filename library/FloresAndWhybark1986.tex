\textbf{brief:}
\vspace{5pt}

The authors present a method for multicriteria ABC analysis called Joint Criteria Matrix along with some application examples.
\vspace{5pt}

\textbf{Joint Criteria Matrix method}
\vspace{5pt}

According to this method, items are classified according to two distinct criteria (usually concurrent), and then a matrix is used for reclassification.
\vspace{5pt}

\textbf{useful:}
\vspace{5pt}

The authors present a good and detailed explanation for the ABC analysis method as well as a detailed explanation of several alternative criteria used for ranking the importance of inventory items: obsolescence, lead times, substitutability, repairability, criticality and commonality.

\vspace{5pt}

\textbf{extension:}
\vspace{5pt}

\cite{FloresAndWhybark1987} present an extensive comparative study of the application of Joint Criteria Matrix method in a company in the service sector and in a company in the manufacturing sector.
